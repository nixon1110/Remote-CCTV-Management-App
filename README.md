Abstract:


Nowadays, the prevalence of threats from thieves has been gradually decreasing, thanks to the presence of surveillance cameras and surveillance systems. However, a major challenge lies in the constant monitoring of cameras from different brands such as Dahua, Hikvision, Cp Plus, etc. This becomes even more difficult when using various mobile apps supported by these brands like gCMOB, Hik-Connect, DMSS, etc. Each app is only compatible with its respective brand, and if using a Network Video Recorder (NVR) or Digital Video Recorder (DVR), the monitoring is limited to the same router. To address this issue, a communication device utilizing the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B has been implemented to connect cameras from all brands. This system is designed to detect motion and send alerts to the user's mobile device through a single app. The app allows users to register cameras from different brands and receive events such as alarms, motion detection, and snapshot events from all registered cameras. It is important to note that both the device and the user's cameras must be connected to the same router for seamless operation. By leveraging the OpenAPIs provided by the respective companies, events can be transmitted from the cameras to the device, from the device to the cloud, and finally from the cloud to the user's mobile device.
